# [adhd](adhd.ruby.games)

a funny game about not-so-funny problems

## what? 

this "game" was made by me on and off over the course of about a week. it is based off of my own experiences of living with adhd. it can get hard! 

## why? 

- i needed an excuse to learn svelte
- i thought it would be fun
  - i was wrong, but it is fun to watch others play it! 

## how?

adhd is developed in svelte, with no external libraries used (besides the ones used by svelte.) 

## who? 

this experience was mady by me, [rubyr](https://github.com/rubyr).
